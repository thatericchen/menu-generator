## Install Guide
### Prerequisite Installations
- Java 17
- GCP
- MongoDB 7.0

### GCP Instructions and MongoDB Configuration:
#### GCP Setup
Download Google Cloud CLI for your respective OS and run the script to install it.
- GCP credit application.
- Make sure Billing Information is set up.
- Create a new project.

Deploy to GCP.
- Run `gcloud -v` to make sure the Google Cloud CLI is installed.
- Run `gcloud init` to initialize google cloud.
- Make sure to choose the default configuration.
- You will then be prompted to login with your email (make sure to use the email that has billing set up with the credits provided).

#### Database Setup
MongoDB
- Create an environment variable, for example, `MONGODB_URI`, and assign your MongoDB connection string to this variable.
  - Format: `mongodb+srv://[username]:[password]@[cluster-address]/[database]`.
- Configure MongoDB in GCP to auto-create the database if it doesn't exist.
- Assign required roles and securely store the service account's credentials.
- Create an administrative user in MongoDB for database management.
- Replace placeholders in the URL: `spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb+srv://adminUser:yourSecurePassword@cluster-address/database`.
- Use your actual admin username, password, and cluster address.
- Implement this URL in your application's configuration.

Once successfully deployed, there will be a URL in the console to take you to where the project is deployed.

If not, runï¼š

- `gcloud app browse`

Clean up to avoid billing charges: Project settings -> shut down project

## Troubleshooting <a name="troubleshooting"></a>
If you encounter issues while running the app, refer to the following common problems and their solutions:

### MongoDB Configuration
- **Issue:** The app is not connecting to the MongoDB instance when running locally.
- **Solution:** Ensure that you have a running MongoDB instance and place the connection link in the environmental variables. Use the format `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-address>` replacing `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<cluster-address>` with your MongoDB credentials and address.

### Bug Fixes
- **QR Code Not Scanning Properly**
  - **Problem:** QR codes generated are not scannable or lead to incorrect links.
  - **Solution:** Ensure QR codes have adequate resolution and contrast. Validate the encoded URL for correctness before generating the QR code.
- **UI Inconsistencies across Devices:**
  - **Problem:** The user interface is not rendering consistently on all devices.
  - **Future Solution:** Adaptive UI has not been implemented yet, so this can be a future feature to implement.

### .env in `./menu-gen-frontend/`
Make sure to create a .env file with the following contents:
`BACKEND_URI="https://cs-3300-final-project.ue.r.appspot.com"`
If you are not using the deployed backend, you can change that URL to anything you want.

## Next Steps
### Advanced Customization Options for Menus
Introduce more diverse templates, fonts, and layout options to allow for greater customization of menus.

### Dynamic Menu Updates
Enable real-time menu updates, allowing restaurants to instantly change items, prices, or availability. Notifications for customers about new items or daily specials.
